I created an interactive procedural version of Tyler Hobbs' And So I Said Hello using TouchDesigner. The project utilizes shapes, feedback loops, transformations, and composition techniques to replicate the structured, algorithmic nature of the original artwork. It incorporates spectrum analysis and microphone input, allowing audio data to directly influence visual elements in real time. Tyler Hobbs is known for using algorithms to create structured, rule-based generative art. This project follows a similar approach by leveraging procedural logic to dynamically shape the composition.
